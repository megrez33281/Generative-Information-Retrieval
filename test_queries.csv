252,"Encodes YAML representation.

    This is a mixin method for writing enum values to YAML. It needs to be added to the enum
    as a classmethod. See the module docstring for further information on this approach and how
    to implement it.

    This method writes whatever is used in the string representation of the YAML value.
    Usually, this will be the unique name of the enumeration value. If the name is used,
    the corresponding ``EnumFromYAML`` mixin can be used to recreate the value. If the name
    isn't used, more care may be necessary, so a ``from_yaml`` method for that particular
    enumeration may be necessary.

    Note:
        This method assumes that the name of the enumeration value should be stored as a scalar node.

    Args:
        representer: Representation from YAML.
        data: Enumeration value to be encoded.
    Returns:
        Scalar representation of the name of the enumeration value."

        When an ARIMA is fit with an exogenous array, it must be forecasted
        with one also. Since at ``predict`` time in a pipeline we won't have
        ``y`` (and we may not yet have an ``exog`` array), we have to know how
        far into the future for which to compute Fourier terms (hence
        ``n_periods``).

        This method will compute the Fourier features for a given frequency and
        ``k`` term. Note that the ``y`` values are not used to compute these,
        so this does not pose a risk of data leakage.

        Parameters
        ----------
        y : array-like or None, shape=(n_samples,)
            The endogenous (time-series) array. This is unused and technically
            optional for the Fourier terms, since it uses the pre-computed
            ``n`` to calculate the seasonal Fourier terms.

        exogenous : array-like or None, shape=(n_samples, n_features), optional
            The exogenous array of additional covariates. If specified, the
            Fourier terms will be column-bound on the right side of the matrix.
            Otherwise, the Fourier terms will be returned as the new exogenous
            array.

        n_periods : int, optional (default=0)
            The number of periods in the future to forecast. If ``n_periods``

        * voltage stability at all nodes

        Notes
        -----
            The validation is done for every tested MV grid configuration during CVRP algorithm. The current rating is
            checked using load factors from [#]_. Due to the high amount of steps the voltage rating cannot be checked
            using load flow calculation. Therefore we use a simple method which determines the voltage change between
            two consecutive nodes according to [#]_.
            Furthermore it is checked if new route has got more nodes than allowed (typ. 2*10 according to [#]_).

354,"Return a list of given length from a scalar parameter.

    The typical use case is when a single value or a sequence of
    values is accepted as input. This function makes a list from
    a given sequence or a list of identical elements from a single
    value, with cast to a given parameter type if desired.

    To distinguish a parameter sequence from a single parameter, the
    following rules are applied:

    * If ``param`` is not a sequence, it is treated as a single
      parameter (e.g. ``1``).
    * If ``len(param) == length == 1``, then ``param`` is interpreted
      as a single parameter (e.g. ``[1]`` or ``'1'``).
    * If ``len(param) == length != 1``, then ``param`` is interpreted as
      sequence of parameters.
    * Otherwise, ``param`` is interpreted as a single parameter.

    Note that this function is not applicable to parameters which are
    themselves iterable (e.g. ``'abc'`` with ``length=3`` will be
    interpreted as equivalent to ``['a', 'b', 'c']``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    param :
        Input parameter to turn into a list.
    length : nonnegative int
        Desired length of the output list.
    param_conv : callable, optional
        Conversion applied to each list element. ``None`` means no conversion.
    keep_none : bool, optional
        If ``True``, ``None`` is not converted.
    return_nonconv : bool, optional
        If ``True``, return also the list where no conversion has been
        applied.

    Returns
    -------
    plist : list
        Input parameter turned into a list of length ``length``.
    nonconv : list
        The same as ``plist``, but without conversion. This is only
        returned if ``return_nonconv == True``.

    Examples
    --------
    Turn input into a list of given length, possibly by broadcasting.
    By default, no conversion is performed.

    >>> normalized_scalar_param_list((1, 2, 3), 3)
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> normalized_scalar_param_list((1, None, 3.0), 3)
    [1, None, 3.0]

    Single parameters are broadcast to the given length.

    >>> normalized_scalar_param_list(1, 3)
    [1, 1, 1]
    >>> normalized_scalar_param_list('10', 3)
    ['10', '10', '10']
    >>> normalized_scalar_param_list(None, 3)
    [None, None, None]

    List entries can be explicitly converted using ``param_conv``. If
    ``None`` should be kept, set ``keep_none`` to ``True``:

    >>> normalized_scalar_param_list(1, 3, param_conv=float)
    [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
    >>> normalized_scalar_param_list('10', 3, param_conv=int)
    [10, 10, 10]
    >>> normalized_scalar_param_list((1, None, 3.0), 3, param_conv=int,
    ...                              keep_none=True)  # default
    [1, None, 3]

    The conversion parameter can be any callable:

    >>> def myconv(x):
    ...     return False if x is None else bool(x)
    >>> normalized_scalar_param_list((0, None, 3.0), 3, param_conv=myconv,

    pickles.

    Parameters
    ----------

    pfpkl_list : list of str
        The list of period-finding pickles to use.

    lcbasedir : str
        The base directory where the associated light curves are located.

    outdir : str
        The directory where the results will be written.

    starfeaturesdir : str or None
        The directory containing the `starfeatures-<objectid>.pkl` files for
        each object to use calculate neighbor proximity light curve features.

    fourierorder : int
        The Fourier order to use to generate sinusoidal function and fit that to
        the phased light curve.

    transitparams : list of floats
        The transit depth, duration, and ingress duration to use to generate a
        trapezoid planet transit model fit to the phased light curve. The period
        used is the one provided in `period`, while the epoch is automatically
        obtained from a spline fit to the phased light curve.

    ebparams : list of floats
        The primary eclipse depth, eclipse duration, the primary-secondary depth
        ratio, and the phase of the secondary eclipse to use to generate an
        eclipsing binary model fit to the phased light curve. The period used is
        the one provided in `period`, while the epoch is automatically obtained
        from a spline fit to the phased light curve.

    pdiff_threshold : float
        This is the max difference between periods to consider them the same.

    sidereal_threshold : float
        This is the max difference between any of the 'best' periods and the
        sidereal day periods to consider them the same.

    sampling_peak_multiplier : float
        This is the minimum multiplicative factor of a 'best' period's
        normalized periodogram peak over the sampling periodogram peak at the
        same period required to accept the 'best' period as possibly real.

    sampling_startp, sampling_endp : float
        If the `pgramlist` doesn't have a time-sampling Lomb-Scargle
        periodogram, it will be obtained automatically. Use these kwargs to
        control the minimum and maximum period interval to be searched when
        generating this periodogram.

    timecols : list of str or None
        The timecol keys to use from the lcdict in calculating the features.

    magcols : list of str or None
        The magcol keys to use from the lcdict in calculating the features.

    errcols : list of str or None
        The errcol keys to use from the lcdict in calculating the features.

    lcformat : str
        This is the `formatkey` associated with your light curve format, which
        you previously passed in to the `lcproc.register_lcformat`
        function. This will be used to look up how to find and read the light
        curves specified in `basedir` or `use_list_of_filenames`.

    lcformatdir : str or None
        If this is provided, gives the path to a directory when you've stored
        your lcformat description JSONs, other than the usual directories lcproc
        knows to search for them in. Use this along with `lcformat` to specify
        an LC format JSON file that's not currently registered with lcproc.

    sigclip : float or int or sequence of two floats/ints or None
        If a single float or int, a symmetric sigma-clip will be performed using
        the number provided as the sigma-multiplier to cut out from the input
        time-series.

        If a list of two ints/floats is provided, the function will perform an
        'asymmetric' sigma-clip. The first element in this list is the sigma
        value to use for fainter flux/mag values; the second element in this
        list is the sigma value to use for brighter flux/mag values. For
        example, `sigclip=[10., 3.]`, will sigclip out greater than 10-sigma
        dimmings and greater than 3-sigma brightenings. Here the meaning of
        ""dimming"" and ""brightening"" is set by *physics* (not the magnitude
        system), which is why the `magsarefluxes` kwarg must be correctly set.

        If `sigclip` is None, no sigma-clipping will be performed, and the
        time-series (with non-finite elems removed) will be passed through to
        the output.

    verbose : bool
        If True, will indicate progress while working.

    maxobjects : int
        The total number of objects to process from `pfpkl_list`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : `DiscreteLpElement` or `array-like`
        Input data to compare to the ground truth. If not a
        `DiscreteLpElement`, a default space with cell size 1 will be assumed.

475,"r""""""Eliminate diagonally dominance.

    Helper function that eliminates diagonally dominant rows and cols from A
    in the separate matrix C.  This is useful because it eliminates nodes in C
    which we don't want coarsened.  These eliminated nodes in C just become
    the rows and columns of the identity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : {csr_matrix, bsr_matrix}
        Sparse NxN matrix
    C : {csr_matrix}
        Sparse MxM matrix, where M is the number of nodes in A.  M=N if A
        is CSR or is BSR with blocksize 1.  Otherwise M = N/blocksize.
    theta : {float}
        determines diagonal dominance threshhold

    Returns
    -------
    C : {csr_matrix}
        C updated such that the rows and columns corresponding to diagonally
        dominant rows in A have been eliminated and replaced with rows and
        columns of the identity.

    Notes
    -----
    Diagonal dominance is defined as
    :math:`\| (e_i, A) - a_{ii} \|_1  <  \\theta a_{ii}`
    that is, the 1-norm of the off diagonal elements in row i must be less than
    theta times the diagonal element.

    a mixture of geostastical structures and parameter bounds information.
    The covariance of parameters associated with geostatistical structures is defined
    as a mixture of GeoStruct and bounds.  That is, the GeoStruct is used to construct a
    pyemu.Cov, then the entire pyemu.Cov is scaled by the uncertainty implied by the bounds and
    sigma_range. Sounds complicated...

    Parameters
    ----------
    pst : pyemu.Pst
        a control file (or the name of control file)
    struct_dict : dict
        a python dict of GeoStruct (or structure file), and list of pp tpl files pairs
        If the values in the dict are pd.DataFrames, then they must have an
        'x','y', and 'parnme' column.  If the filename ends in '.csv',
        then a pd.DataFrame is loaded, otherwise a pilot points file is loaded.
    sigma_range : float
        a float representing the number of standard deviations implied by parameter bounds.
        Default is 4.0, which implies 95% confidence parameter bounds.
    par_knowledge_dict : dict
        used to condition on existing knowledge about parameters.  This functionality is
        currently in dev - don't use it.
    verbose : bool
        stdout flag
    Returns
    -------
    Cov : pyemu.Cov
        a covariance matrix that includes all adjustable parameters in the control
        file.

    Example
    -------
    ``>>>import pyemu``

    ``>>>pst = pyemu.Pst(""pest.pst"")``

    ``>>>sd = {""struct.dat"":[""hkpp.dat.tpl"",""vka.dat.tpl""]}``
